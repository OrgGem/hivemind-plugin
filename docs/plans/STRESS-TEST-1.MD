## Stress test survivor:

1. Design me a stress test as critical validator for the following:

Imagine if the product-ready and integrity check of your, and in the case that you have 100% confident with validation (as hard proof from both codes, and research backed knowledge)  and if those passed with 100% merit → the stress test, when in completion, can turn that 100% pass with merit into a failure of only 30% grade - But that does not mean the test is a retard of nonsensical. By accessing these you may design such test to loop your team of agents over again:

1. There is a mode called “I am retard” where users can set at init CLI (btw check if this does not exist, by either installed with npm or github → users must have at least 5 options (that include language of spoken and of document (give them list of languages with international id such as en, vi, etc); governance level; automation - both governance and automation will have the last choice as “I am retard - lead me” → these will persist not only beginning but also through a very long and ongoing through compact messages: which also means following: 
    1. the system must have multiple fail-safe and fallback safe (non-breaking) - and the mechanism better be an automation (because there are no trust on even multiple ai-backed mechanism) 
    2. above also means when a retard build a project → it is a mess of many things grandiose but most times non work → they expect many things work but you MUST BUILD A SYSTEM THAT READY TO ARGUE BACK AS LONG AS THEY COLLECT ENOUGH EVIDENCES → which also means
        1. time and git hash are always the source of truth to trace
        2. hierarchy and relationship are extremely important → if they break they must alert the mutual and relational
        3. that also means the integrity of path, naming, serial numbering and strict schema and fast tracking tools and libraries can survive the teams through this → because if not at any given point to not being able to bash just one command to know the truth → that’s failure
        4. As the retard very highly likely behaviors are to bombard chunk of texts, change their minds multiple times, do not care about architecture, get made, cursing throughout, cause high stress and confusion ; drag the level 4 complexity project to the points “I want all features” and 10 compacts have been on to the same conversation → this is the kind of stress test we should survive
        5. prevention of “happy-path” → governance by using SKILL (create-skill) (find and learn in with the way the skill “superpower” is using to enforce the starter by throwing reasoning into “WHY NOT DOING s.thing” → as said above thought like “You are right” in the chain of thoughts in many LLMs nowadays are the pitfalls to this → knowing, users can be a retard that never know what is right and they will argue their way back
        6. that also means the system must be able to and give aid to ai agents trace back to at which point in time, of what session, and the plan user has said….
    3. but AI agents are extremely prone to confusion → so there are no spaces for a tiny conflict (as for if too many things come to, at the same time, communicating different ideas)
    4. The system must teach the Agents from the very starting that from any given sessions, regardless of governance level and/or automation level (they must always be able to tell that they work in a team → that even when governance setting low, the mindset of never say no to accepting claims without both evidences and validation → enforcing even the light governance mode will bout put the last assistant message or response to user’s message as → “I will do as you instruction but I can detect…”
    5. But also some people they just want to challenge the system by playing retard 
    6. Overall this stress test must bring as many situations (green, brown field) as many points in the project of different size, type, complexity (debug, implement, refactor etc…)
