## Decisions

- 5-system cognitive mesh model remains the governing architecture.
- SDK stays a materialization layer; `src/lib/` remains SDK-free.
- Soft governance remains non-blocking at platform level.
- Framework selection metadata is persisted in brain state for deterministic conflict routing.
- Conflict tier mapping uses governance posture: permissive warn-only, assisted/strict limited mode, strict+full/retard simulated pause.
- [Phase 02]: Persist framework selection metadata in brain state for deterministic dual-framework gating
- [Phase 02]: Conflict response tiers mapped to governance posture: permissive warn-only, assisted/strict limited mode, strict+full/retard simulated pause

## Pending

- Execute `02-02-PLAN.md` in Phase 2.
- Execute `02-04-PLAN.md` in Phase 2.
